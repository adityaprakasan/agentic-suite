## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user visiting the platform, I want to see consistent Adentic branding throughout my experience so that I can identify and trust the platform as an official Adentic product. This includes seeing the Adentic logo, brand colors, and proper legal information across all pages and touchpoints.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the platform homepage, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the Adentic logo, primary brand color (#CC3A00), and Adentic copyright text
2. **Given** a user views any page on the platform, **When** they check the browser tab, **Then** they see Adentic-branded favicon and page title with proper SEO metadata
3. **Given** a user looks for social media links, **When** they check the footer or designated social area, **Then** they find the LinkedIn link (https://www.linkedin.com/company/tryadentic) and other social media links
4. **Given** a user views the platform on any device, **When** the page renders, **Then** all Adentic branding elements display correctly and consistently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when brand assets fail to load? Display text-only "Adentic" company name as fallback
- How does system handle cached old branding after update? Manual cache clearing required
- What appears during the transition period between old and new branding?
