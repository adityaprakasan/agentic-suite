## 🔄 CI/CD Setup

All platforms support Git-based deployments:

### Auto-deploy on Push
1. Connect GitHub to platform
2. Enable auto-deploy in settings
3. Push to main branch
4. Platform automatically builds and deploys

### GitHub Actions (Advanced)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Deploy to Platform
        run: |
          # Platform-specific deploy command
          # See docs/DEPLOYMENT-OPTIONS.md
```

---

## 🌍 Multi-Region Strategy

For global users (> 10K):

1. **Phase 1**: Single region + CloudFlare CDN
   - Frontend cached globally
   - API in primary region
   - Cost: +$20/mo for Cloudflare Pro

2. **Phase 2**: Multi-region backend
   - Fly.io: Built-in (deploy to multiple regions)
   - AWS: ALB + multiple ECS clusters
   - Cost: ~2x single region cost

3. **Phase 3**: Database read replicas
   - Supabase: Use read replicas in additional regions
   - Cost: +$75/mo per replica

- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Queue depth

**Infrastructure**:
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O
- Network bandwidth

**Business Metrics**:
- Active users
- Agent tasks completed
- Average task duration
- Cost per user

### Recommended Tools

**Free**:
- Platform built-in metrics
- Supabase dashboard
- UptimeRobot (uptime monitoring)

**Paid**:
- Datadog ($15-31/host/mo) - Full observability

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Use Render or Railway first. Migrate to AWS when you need to.

2. **Monitor from Day 1**: Set up basic monitoring before launch, not after problems.

3. **Test Load Early**: Run load tests with k6 or Artillery before launching.

4. **Automate Backups**: Supabase auto-backups + your own schedule.

5. **Use CDN**: CloudFlare free tier is excellent. Enable it.

6. **Version Everything**: Tag Docker images with commit SHAs for easy rollback.

7. **Preview Environments**: Use platform preview features for testing PRs.

8. **Cost Alerts**: Set up billing alerts at 50%, 80%, 100% of budget.

9. **Security Scans**: Run `docker scan` and `npm audit` regularly.

10. **Documentation**: Document your deployment process for team members.
